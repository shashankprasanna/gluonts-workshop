### Stationarity

#### A Time Series is stationary if some or all of its moments are not a function of time i.e. mean (𝜇) and variance(𝜎) do not vary with time. In other words, a non-stationary time series is one for the data distribution changes over time.

  <tr>
    <th>Trend stationary: <br>The mean trend is deterministic. Can be remedied by subtracting the trending mean</th>
    <th>Difference stationary: <br>The mean trend is stochastic.. Can be remedied by calculating the difference series</th>
