### Stationarity

A Time Series is stationary if some or all of its moments are not a function of time i.e. mean (𝜇) and variance(𝜎) do not vary with time. In other words, a non-stationary time series is one for the data distribution changes over time.

1. Trend stationary: The mean trend is deterministic.
 * Can be remedied by subtracting the trending mean
2. Difference stationary: The mean trend is stochastic.
 * Can be remedied by calculating the difference series
