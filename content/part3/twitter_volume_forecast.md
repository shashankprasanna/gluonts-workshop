In this section you will learn how to run a time-series forecast using GluonTS. In this example we use the same dataset as before and apply two separate models, DeepAR and a simple multi-layer perceptron. At the end we shall compare the results of the evaluation of both models.

Open `twitter_volume_forecast.ipynb` to get started.
