Gluon Time Series (GluonTS) is the Gluon toolkit for probabilistic time series modeling, focusing on deep learning-based models.

GluonTS provides utilities for loading and iterating over time series datasets, state of the art models ready to be trained, and building blocks to define your own models and quickly experiment with different solutions. With GluonTS you can:

* Train and evaluate any of the built-in models on your own data, and quickly come up with a solution for your time series tasks.
* Use the provided abstractions and building blocks to create custom time series models, and rapidly benchmark them against baseline algorithms.

**GluonTS includes:**

* Higher-level components for building new models
* Data loading and iterators for time series data
* Reference implementations of several state-of-the-art neural forecasting models
* Tooling for evaluating and comparing forecasting models
