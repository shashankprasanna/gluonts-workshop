After understanding our data in the previous section, descriptive statistics, we now want to quickly run a time-series forecast using gluonts. In this example we use the same dataset as before and apply two separate models, DeepAR and a simple multi-layer perceptron. At the end we shall compare the results of the evaluation of both models.

Open `quickstart.ipynb` to get started.
