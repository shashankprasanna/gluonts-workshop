This repository contains the material for the workshop ["AIM347 - Time-series prediction using GluonTS and Amazon SageMaker"](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=98535).


Before you get started with deep learning for time series forecasting, check first the ![tutorial](descriptive_stats.ipynb). This notebook gives a high level overview of the time-series modeling pipeline. By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:
- Preprocess your data
- Develop a baseline model
- Improve your baseline model

Once you have learned the basic concepts, it is time to go to the next ![tutorial](quickstart.ipynb), you will learn how to run a time-series forecast using GluonTS on a simple dataset. You will train a DeepAR model and a simple multilayer perceptron. You can refer to this ![notebook](Intro_to_gluonts.ipynb) to check how to define the GluonTS components.
